    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <p>
        The game Sudoku involves a grid of 81 squares. 
        The grid is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rules of the game are simple: each of the nine blocks has to 
        contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. Each number can 
        only appear once in a row, column or box.
    </p>
    <p>
        The difficulty lies in that each vertical nine-square column, 
        or horizontal nine-square line across, within the larger square, 
        must also contain the numbers 1-9, without repetition or omission.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every puzzle has just one correct solution.
