Game Rules
   1. The game Sudoku involves a grid of 81 squares. 

      The grid is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares.

      The rules of the game are simple: each of the nine blocks has to 
      contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. Each number can 
      only appear once in a row, column or box.
   
      The difficulty lies in that each vertical nine-square column, 
      or horizontal nine-square line across, within the larger square, 
      must also contain the numbers 1-9, without repetition or omission.
   
      Every puzzle has just one correct solution.
